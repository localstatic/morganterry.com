I am a software engineer in Salt Lake City, UT with over 15 years of professional software development experience.

I've worked with a variety of languages and technologies throughout my career.  I am currently working mainly with TypeScript and Node.js. Previously, I spent over a decade working with PHP and related technologies like Composer, Laravel, etc.

I am also interested in a variety of other languages and technologies. I love finding the right technology for the job, and understand that there can be a lot that goes into that decision.
