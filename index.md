## Morgan Terry, Software Engineer

I am a software engineer in Salt Lake City, UT with over 15 years of professional development experience.

I am currently working mainly with TypeScript and Node.js. Previously, I spent over a decade working
with PHP and related technologies like Composer, Laravel, etc.

I am also interested in a variety of other languages and technologies. I love finding the right technology for the job, and understand that there can be a lot that goes into that decision. Here are some of the tools & technologies that I've used to get things done lately:

* TypeScript
* JavaScript / Node.js
* MySQL

In addition, I've worked with a variety of other languages, frameworks and other technologies throughout my career, including:

* PHP
* Laravel
* Drupal
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML &amp; CSS
* jQuery
