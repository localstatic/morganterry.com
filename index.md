## Morgan Terry, Software Engineer

I am a software engineer in Salt Lake City, UT with over 15 years of professional development experience.

I currently work mainly with PHP, and am very glad to see the renaissance it is currently experiencing. I believe things like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHP: The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) are truly making the PHP ecosystem a much better place. A place that I am more excited than ever to be a part of.

In addition to PHP, I am also interested in a variety of other languages and technologies. I love finding the right technology for the job, and understand that there can be a lot that goes into that decision. Here are some of the tools & technologies that I've used to get things done lately:

* PHP
* MySQL
* Laravel

In addition, I've worked with a variety of other languages, frameworks and other technologies throughout my career, including:

* Drupal
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML &amp; CSS
* JavaScript &amp; jQuery
* Magento
* Delphi
