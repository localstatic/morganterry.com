			<h2>I'm a Developer</h2>
			<p>
				I am a senior software engineer living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I have worked with a variety of languages, frameworks, and other technologies.

				For the last seven years, I have been developing web applications using PHP and MySQL. I have over a year of experience heavily customizing and extending the Magento e-commerce platform. I have been working with Drupal for the past year, including development of custom themes and modules. I recently starting diving into Ruby on Rails. I have a couple of projects under my belt now, and so far I'm loving it.

				I have over 10 years of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
