This is the source for my recently-neglected professional site. I'm currently in the process of rewriting it using Jekyll, mostly as an exercise in this newly-discovered tool. 

Hopefully this will allow me to accomplish some of my goals for the site (e.g. Not having to make the same change multiple times if I want to change a common page element), but still be a static site and easy to host.
