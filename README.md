This is the source for my professional site. I've recently rewritten it to use Jekyll for ease of maintenance, and hope to keep it more up-to-date than I have been recently.

Hopefully this rewrite will allow me to accomplish some of my goals for the site (e.g. Not having to make the same change multiple times if I want to change a common page element), but still be a static site and easy to host.
